	<p id="introduction">Hi everyone, my name is Thomas and I'm a globetrotter. I've been traveling the Earth for 2 years now and I decided to share my experiences.
	On this page I'm gonna share with you the best destination for summer 2020. Of course, it's only my opinion !!</p>

	<h2>Sunshine at Miami</h2>
	<img id="images" src="images/miami.jpg" height="250px">
	<p>Under the tropical sunlights, Miami shines in the charts of multicultural cities. The city has never stopped experiencing periods of boom and fall. The real estate boom initiated in the 1920s was followed by the slow decadence of the 1980s. Images of salsa, easy dollars, grand villas, limousines, Harleys and top models were not enough. The pastel of Miami Beach Art Deco buildings is fading ... to be reborn once again with the 2000s.
	The metropolis of the Sunshine State maintains the image of an America that is both glamorous and unbridled. Art Deco has resumed beautiful colors, the villas of stars are wrestling at great prices and the large beach lapped by the warm waters of the Atlantic is always full.</p>

	<h2>Turquoise water in Martinique</h2>
	<img src="images/martinique.jpg" height="250px">
	<p>Martinique is a postcard island, a real bewitching, which knows how to coax the visitor thanks to its white sandy beaches to then better seduce it with its interior riches. In Martinique, there is certainly the sky, the sun and the sea, but also fields of sugar cane, timeless forest paths, villages at the end of the world, fantastic gardens that make you forget the advance of concrete .
	Martinique surprises by its peculiarity to marry the irreconcilable: sugar and rum, rain and sun, bruises that hurt the eyes and tender greens. The trade winds and cyclones. Volcanoes and heavenly vegetation.</p>

	<h2>A lot of nature in Madagascar</h2>
	<img src="images/madagascar.jpeg" height="250px">
	<p>One of the largest islands in the world, the mainland, the Red Island… all these images of Madagascar feed on a mosaic of peoples from migrations, but also of a nature unique in the world, on a background many historical and economic reversals.
	As the land is gradually stripped and the rivers carry the red laterite from coast to coast, the savannah dotted with baobabs recalls Africa and the distant memory of pirates gives green nature a history of Joseph Conrad.
	Madagascar is also the country of the ancestors where we cultivate the memory and the traditions of peoples from Indonesia and Africa.
	Finally, separated from the African continent, Madagascar has developed species of plants and animals unique in the world, including the adorable and leaping lemurs.</p>

	<h2>A ballad on love in Venise</h2>
	<img src="images/venise.jpg" height="250px">
	<p>Venice has this unique ability to create wonder every time you return. No photo will ever set the mood for its winding alleys, its corti, its canals, its bridges and its churches.
	Venice, the Serenissima, is a city born from the sea and turned towards the sea, which has always known how to fight to preserve its independence. From this glorious past, it has kept palaces and old residences which today are so many museums that bear witness to its splendor of yesteryear.
	Venice is the delight on every street corner, a strange mix between deja-vu and the astonishment of discovery, the postcard and the half-word, a great plunge into the Middle Ages and, until his table, a real carnival for the taste buds!</p>

	<h2>France by the French Riviera</h2>
	<img src="images/frenchrivieira.jpg" height="250px">
	<p>The French Riviera is a mythical place: visitors flock there against all odds, some to grill on the beaches and be dazzled by the night lights on the coast, others to discover the hinterland search for greater authenticity.
	Why not reconcile the two? For those who can't stand the French Riviera (too hot, too crowded, too expensive), a few tips: go outside of summer vacation periods, discover Saint-Tropez in the morning at 8 a.m., treat yourself to bowls air inland, walk the coastal path in search of a cushy cove rather than stopping at the beach.
	The French Riviera, the “Côte”, like the hills of the interior, are full of miraculously preserved areas, adorable villages, hospitable and generous little restaurants, hotels and guesthouses that do not provoke purse hemorrhage ...
	And far from the coast of the French Riviera, some corners belong to the curious, to those who know how to think outside the box. Unknown forests with rich aromatic scents and picturesque hilltop villages await you! Land of geographic contrasts, Var and Alpes-Maritimes offer an incredible diversity of landscapes and the possibility of brilliant itineraries.</p>
